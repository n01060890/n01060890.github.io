  <h1>Individual progress report</h1>
  <p>Currently I've managed to integrate multiple DHT11 sensors onto my Raspberry Pi 3, with the help of Adafruit library. As next week is our project presentations, 
      I'm working on integrating everything in the dummy hive, and creating visual presentation where the dummy bee cluster is located in the hive</p>

      <UL>
      <li>At this point everyone is working on his own individual hardware part.</li>
      <li>As I was doing the cluster detection, I'm currently studying the Python's Turtle graphics in order to present the location of the cluster.</li>
      <li>So far, on financial side, nothing been changed. </li>

  <h1>Individual progress report</h1>
  <p>Last Saturday on November 12th was the Open House held in the Humber College. There my teammates and myself were presenting currest progress on our projects.</p>

      <UL>
      <LI> Unfortunatelly all the feedbacks on our project were positive, with no recommendations. 
			But definitely all the visitors, who came to our table, were interested and we've been describing our progress and where we are aiming.</LI>
      <li>At this point everyone is working on his own individual hardware part.</li>
      <li>Currently I am experiencing a problem of integrating more than 1 dht11 sensor onto my Raspberry Pi, as sensor requires GPIO_GCLK, and there is only one of those.</li>
      <li>So far, on financial side, nothing been changed.  </li>

  <h1>Individual progress report</h1>
  <p>This week is our Individual progress report due, as well as Hardware Demonstration at Open House Saturday November 12 10am – 2pm.</p>

      <UL>
      <LI> At his point we were able to laser cut our casing for the project in prototype lab, using CorelDRAW software. All the slots were cutted to hold all the sensors used.
          Also, I was wiring and writing software for my sensors to work together and give cluster information location. So far all the reading are working, but the logic 
          on cluster detection is still under development. I should be able to accomplish everything by Saturday. So far I am following the project schedule.</LI>
      <li>So far the development and creating the casing was made by our team last week. At this point everyone is working on his own individual hardware part.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I've encountered, was burning one of my sensors, due to inattention to circuit built.</li>
      <li>So far, on financial side, nothing been changed.  </li>

  <h1>The placard</h1>
  <p>This week is our placard submission. We have designed on the concept of how our future project will look like, and made the placard with description of it.</p>

      <UL>
      <LI> At his point we've modeled our furure project, by using cardboard. Hopefully we will be able to print the casing on the 3D printer, or do it from wood. 
          So far I am following the project schedule.</LI>
      <li>As for this time, my team members and me have met, assembled and modeled the concept of our final hardware project. 
          It still need to be worked on, by using appropriate materials, to be able to work out</li>
      <li>The only problem for now will be deciding what materials to use for casing, and how to implement them properly.</li>
      <li>So far, on financial side, nothing been changed. The only further expences might occure when we'll be building our casing mounting. </li>

  <h1>Power-up Milestone</h1>
  <p>Today was our power-up milestone. In lab we were demonstrating our working PCBs with sensors, which provided us with readings. 
  We were using programs to get the readings provided by teacher. In my case, as may be seen from the videos, all sensors were working.</p>

      <LI> At his point I've done assembling and checking the PCB. It works well with sensors, and provides correct readings. So far I am following the project schedule.</LI>
      <li>As for this time, my team members and me have met and started assembling and modeling the final hardware project. We've been using cardboard to create the concept.</li>
      <li>Some problems we encountered with PCB, as the LED wasn't working, but after testing the problem was solved. I had bad soldering which resulted in this promblem.</li>
      <li>So far, on financial side, nothing been changed. We have all required parts to work with. </li>

  <h1>Mechanical assembly milestone</h1>
  <p>
      <UL>
      <LI> At his point I've done soldering of the PCB which is due this week on my project scedule.</LI>
      <li> So far I need to check at prototype lab if the correct voltages are produced, in order not to burn my Raspberry PI.</li>  
      <li> So far I haven't experienced any issues, except I need to make sure that my PCB works properly. Our teacher Kristian Medri <br />
          suggested our team to check the prototype of the project, which is simmilar to our in Huber College, and contact teacher<br /> 
          Peter Wheeler, who is in charge of this project, to get useful information on what he researched.</li> 
      <li> For my part of the projct I've alredy got all the parts that I need and I am on trak in our financial status. My budget so far is $114.84 :
          <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Board : CDN$ 57.49</li>
          <li>Enokay Case for Raspberry Pi 3 : CDN$ 9.99</li>
          <LI>HDMI Cable : CDN$ 9.99</LI>
          <li>Protection glasses : CDN$ 4.99</li>
          <li>DTH11 sensors x5: CDN$ 16.89</li>
          <li>MicroSD 32gb : CDN$ 16.49</li>

  <h1>Individual progress report</h1>
  <p>As for this time, my team members and me have figured out who is doing which part of final project. 
  I am doing the temperature/humidity sensors implementation, in order to see the fluctuation of these data in the hive. 
  This will be useful to be able to understand what is happening with hives. In order to be able to do it, after small research on web, 
  I figured out that the best sensor that will satisfy my needs is Temperature & Humidity Sensor DHT11. In order to get more accurate 
  measurement, I’ve bought 5 pieces of this sensor from the local retailer. <p>
