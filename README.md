# Smart Hive

Our project allows beekeepers to monitor multiple geographically distant hives via smartphones and tablets.

Externally, the Smart Hive documents changes in the hive's weight, and counts incoming and outgoing bees.
Internally, it captures multiple temperature and humidity data, in order to locate the bee cluster over the winter.
